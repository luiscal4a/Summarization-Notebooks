# Summarization-Notebooks

To execute the cells in the notebook either import them to Google Drive or execute them as jupyter notebooks in your local machine using the command ```jupyter notebook``` in the root repository folder.

Take into account that the data is imported and exported in the notebooks through Google Drive, so you will have to modify the scripts to either suit your Google Drive paths or use files locally.
